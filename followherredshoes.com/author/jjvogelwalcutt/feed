<p>Today I briefed them on our DoD Instruction Policy that will be going into effect soon. This policy outlines the requirements and responsibilities for the development, management, and evaluation of distributed learning for military and civilians. In other words – it tells the Department of Defense how to choose and use the very best technology for training around the world.<img class="size-medium wp-image-766 alignright" src="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_20170301_125638686-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_20170301_125638686-300x169.jpg 300w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_20170301_125638686-768x432.jpg 768w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_20170301_125638686-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> As we share this information with the Navy directly, we empower their leadership to share this policy and to require companies that build for the Navy to follow the specifications (or rules for how to manage data from one technology to another) so that all branches and all systems can work together. <img class="size-medium wp-image-768 alignleft" src="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_20170302_184021-223x300.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="300" srcset="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_20170302_184021-223x300.jpg 223w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_20170302_184021-768x1034.jpg 768w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_20170302_184021-761x1024.jpg 761w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_20170302_184021.jpg 1083w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" />THIS is what we call innovative solutions for efficiency!!!</p>

As Orlando becomes a known hub for innovation, more companies are relocating to this area. Accordingly, we need manufacturing spaces in which to develop prototypes. The Bridg, located in Osceola country, FL is helping to build smart sensors with the help of the University of Central Florida and other companies. Today, representatives from the Navy, Advanced Distribute Learning (ME), and Federal Law Enforcement toured the facilities to better connect our industries. If we can gather data through micro, smart sensors – and join that with specialized data analytics models – then we can adapted just about anything to your personal needs!!</p>

WHY ISN’T THIS EMPHASIZED FOR AMERICA??? OF COURSE we should be bringing in the latest ideas for how to develop our infrastructure. If we have ANY hopes of keeping up with the rest of the world, the notion that “it worked for me so it will work for you” must be put to rest. Innovation is the hallmark of progress and many of the smaller, more agile countries have the ability to out run us in this area. Their size acts to their advantage.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-751 alignleft" src="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170228_134416538_TOP-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170228_134416538_TOP-300x169.jpg 300w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170228_134416538_TOP-768x432.jpg 768w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170228_134416538_TOP-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Meanwhile….the Department of Energy’s National Training Center (<a href="https://ntc.doe.gov/">https://ntc.doe.gov/</a>) calls me to discuss innovative ways to improve their training. Is it enough, you should ask yourself, to teach basic safety? Or would you feel safer if our individuals at nuclear power plants were practicing in simulators to address possible cyber attacks and technology failures? With only basic elearning practices (taking online courses), there is a limit to what can be taught and practiced. But in my lab and in my position, we can share the latest in learning innovation and improve all these departments!</p>

<p>You might have noticed that there has been a steady stream of recommendations about reducing the size of government. But have you heard much about the effects of such a widespread change? The reality is that there are many functions our government performs – many, many, MANY of which you are likely not aware.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-746 alignleft" src="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170222_134621224-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170222_134621224-300x169.jpg 300w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170222_134621224-768x432.jpg 768w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170222_134621224-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> So what happens when there is a hiring freeze? No positions can be filled. This of course makes sense, at the basic level. But WHICH vacancies go unfilled? The heads of both training and education for the military have chosen retirement amidst the change in administration. Do we feel comfortable sending our new many thousands of increased military personnel into battle without someone senior overseeing the coordination of their training and education? Family services for military has also gone vacant for the same reason. Every time I go to the Pentagon, I hear of more and more and more retirements. The individuals have 20-40+ years experience….are we comfortable as a nation knowing that these positions are unfilled by senior people?<img class="size-medium wp-image-745 alignleft" src="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170222_134456967-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170222_134456967-300x169.jpg 300w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170222_134456967-768x432.jpg 768w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170222_134456967-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> Maybe we will create a huge turnover and the outcome will be a smaller, more efficient government. Maybe we will have junior people making decisions that aren’t yet qualified to do so. One recent example in one of the military branches involved a low level officer deciding to change the contract for the civilian scientific experts to what is called “lowest bid, technically acceptable.”</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-744 alignleft" src="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170222_134413744-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170222_134413744-300x169.jpg 300w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170222_134413744-768x432.jpg 768w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170222_134413744-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The result was that the individuals in that group, many of whom had 15+ years experience in this branch, were told their pay would be reduced by more than half. Individuals with PhDs rarely make the $42K they were offered. Some with bachelor’s degrees were offered $20K. The majority quit on the spot. The individuals willing to take positions paying that low are unlikely to be able to perform the duties adequately.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-743" src="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170222_132610840-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170222_132610840-300x169.jpg 300w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170222_132610840-768x432.jpg 768w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170222_132610840-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><em>Is that our goal? Lowest cost government? Should we be concerned with functionally acceptable? Would you take a position paying less than half of what you are making now in order to serve and improve America?</em></p>

One-on-one teachers are the most effective, in most cases, for learning. But it is not always possible or cost-effective to teach in that manner all the time. So we turn to technology.</p>

Though funded under the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness), the scientists in this lab are creating the rules (or specifications) that will be used worldwide for industry, government, and academia to ensure that every learning experience you have can inform your next one.</p>

When the administration changes, the new President must appoint approximately 4,000 new employees – and they are at the levels just below the secretaries. It is a daunting task for anyone. For a President new to government, I can only imagine it is a significant undertaking. Each of these individuals must be approved by Congress….creating a huge burden on them as well. When the political party remains the same, many of the appointees from the previous administration stay on but when the party changes, nearly everyone moves. The folks that are the glue during these changes are the loyal career civil servants. Were it not for these individuals, we would struggle substantially when our government changes. Imagine just trying to get your computer working or finding files! And what if your filing system differs from the last set of people?! It is imperative that we, as Americans, appreciate the work that these career government employees do. Without them, we would have a government that is susceptible to infiltration by foreign threats every four years! I had no idea how vulnerable we could be!! “Government workers” get a bad rap for being slow moving, unmotivated workers. I have seen anything but that.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-716 alignleft" src="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170217_103212-294x300.jpg" alt="" width="294" height="300" srcset="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170217_103212-294x300.jpg 294w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170217_103212-768x782.jpg 768w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170217_103212-1005x1024.jpg 1005w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170217_103212.jpg 1431w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" />But why does all this matter now??? Because many workers who have been in government for 10-20 years are leaving service due to the change in administration, it means many positions are open and when they eventually get filled, the person will be untrained in the position. Further, it means laboratories like ours are left without what is called ‘top cover’. We don’t have anyone to help approve travel or ensure our budget is maintained. Essentially….we are operating like an island and may continue to operate like this through the rest of the fiscal year! It’s important as ever now that we all work together to do our jobs to the very best of our abilities to help Americans!!</p>

<p>Second….two memorandums today surfaces on my desk: Guidance of President Trump’s Status as a Candidate and Its Effect on Activity in the Federal Workplace (from the U.S. Office of Special Counsel) and Naming Convention for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (from the Office of the Secretary of Defense). Wow!</p>
<p>And I quote, “President Trump has filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission establishing that <u>he is a candidate in the 2020 Presidential election</u>.” Well that’s interesting….  It continues to say, “…the Hatch Act does not prohibit federal employees, either on duty or off duty, from….expressing their approval or disapproval of President Trump or his Administration, policies, or actions.”  Note: The Hatch Act (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatch_Act_of_1939">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatch_Act_of_1939</a>) prohibits federal employees from running for partisan office and from openly supporting or not supporting candidates. We can vote, we just can’t express our opinions at work. But it turns out, that is only for <em><u>candidates</u></em> – not already elected officials who are working. So just so I’m clear…I can cheer or complain as often as I like at work or anywhere else while the president (or his administration) is working….butttttt…..not while they are trying to win? Somehow this seems rather backward. It’s like saying…Don’t tell me what you think until AFTER the decisions have been made. Brilliant. Further, we expect people to have government experience but then disallow government workers to run for office. Again – what company would give preferential treatment to individuals with no working experience in their company and their company’s products??? There has to be a better answer.  What about a preliminary set of individuals who are pre-elected for the following term? In other words, what if in 2020 we elected a Pres/VP but also a set of 8-10 individuals from both parties who spend the next 2.5 years learning about government and planning their campaigns? Then we could encourage people without personal enormous fortunes and people who have expertise in something other than politics to run. I am officially dubbing it the Presidential Apprentice Program. (rather interesting choice of words given the current President’s former TV experience…) <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Now for ISIS… There was talk that the term was going to become DAESH but it seems that has not been adopted by President Trump. “Consistent with National Security Presidential Memorandum-3 of January 28, 2017, “Plan to Defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria,”……the Department of Defense will use the term Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, when referring to this threat.”  Well, OK!</p>
<p>I’d like to say that these memorandums seem overly directive – but in truth, we have received little guidance and believe it or not, I get most of my information from Twitter. So I am pleased that we are receiving legal clarification regarding what we can and cannot say – in and out of the office.</p>

FLETC – Federal Law Enforcement Training Center needs my help. I think I need a cape. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I feel like a superheroine! Dr. JJ to the rescue!! Hahahaha – No but seriously – for so many years you feel like you are learning and learning and moving up and learning some more and listening and then….all of a sudden…you find out you are the EXPERT in the room and you realize – oh my goodness! It’s time for me to jump in and help. It’s thrilling to know you have the potential to influence the world. So few of us get the opportunity – I’m taking it seriously!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-705 alignleft" src="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170213_153712595-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170213_153712595-300x169.jpg 300w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170213_153712595-768x432.jpg 768w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170213_153712595-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Meanwhile….Flynn resigns. Interesting though – How does the government decide what you should or should share with others? If it’s not classified, can I share MY interpretation of our country? Is there an OFFICIAL position of general information? I read twitter like everyone else. I read articles like everyone else. I have some briefings but for the most part, I am just high enough to speak for the government but just low enough that I am not included in most of the official activities at the top. Which meeeeaaaannnnnssss…..I am required to infer and determine for myself what our country thinks and wants. I assume, given that I’m concerned an expert in an area, that speaking for our country means I will do as good of a job as anyone else. But still – WHO is speaking for US? And WHAT are they saying? Do we really know??? Or does it just come out when there is a scandal? Things to consider….</p>

<p>First of all – know what time your ride leaves. OMG – I got a call from the front desk – Ma’am, your ride is leaving. Shenanigans!! I’m still in bed! I literally throw my clothes together and run – yes run – out the door. My word! I thought I had a full hour to pack yet. Turns out, I did but they still decided to leave early. &lt;sigh&gt; Everyone checks my passport – no one, in either country, asks me any interesting questions at all. Should I assume I look nonthreatening???</p>
<p>The flight was….long. My boss has the ability to work well past the exhaustion point – I am totally incapable at my age to compete. Eventually, my body just says – NO. STOP WORKING. But on international flights, there is much food to eat, all you can drink (I made that mistake once as a teenager and never did it again – there is nothing worse than being jet lagged, dehydrated, and hung over all at once – OMG).  I FINALLY got home around 11pm EST after starting out at 11am EET (Finland time) – which is a true total of 19 hours of traveling. But mama duties start bright and early Saturday morning at 7am – gotta get moving so my daughter can get ready for her friend’s birthday party!!!</p>
<p><strong>Lesson learned: Life keeps moving – even when you see to be stuck over the Atlantic….</strong></p>

<p>It was truly amazing to sit in the morning meeting. After spending three days focused on general discussion that at times appeared hindered by language barriers to the point of not being productive, our Chairman from NATO HQ wrapped up our “taskers” (the task items given to our working group to support NATO Command) with a level of brilliance that made me pause to appreciate. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-613" src="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170209_033248-300x293.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="293" srcset="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170209_033248-300x293.jpg 300w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170209_033248-768x751.jpg 768w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170209_033248-1024x1001.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <img class="alignnone  wp-image-614" src="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170209_093017-300x182.jpg" alt="" width="353" height="214" srcset="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170209_093017-300x182.jpg 300w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170209_093017-768x467.jpg 768w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170209_093017-1024x623.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" />  <img class="alignnone  wp-image-623" src="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170209_020103198-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="138" height="245" srcset="http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170209_020103198-169x300.jpg 169w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170209_020103198-768x1365.jpg 768w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170209_020103198-576x1024.jpg 576w, http://followherredshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170209_020103198.jpg 1458w" sizes="(max-width: 138px) 100vw, 138px" /></p>
<p>Turns out, we HAD covered all these topics – albeit in a roundabout manner – but still, we accomplished significant progress toward our stated goals and had much concrete information to provide up the chain of command. Awesome! Additionally, the international relations that were improved – an unmeasurable but highly important task – made the trip and cost to tax payers absolutely worth it.</p>

<p>One really interesting activity we did on this day was to go around the room discussing the differences and challenges to each of our defense departments (called typically by others MOD for Ministries of Defence – yes, spelled overseas with a ‘c’). Many of the military systems worldwide still use conscripts, or required military service. It’s an interesting notion that our country does not use but when young men and women are required to serve their nations, I have to imagine their understanding of the value of the service people provide is much higher, as is their patriotism.</p>

<p>Also, some of the nations maintain a small professional army but an enormous reserve system. Wouldn’t this be an interesting concept for our venture into cyberspace? We are really finding it a challenge to attract the top talent in cyber because it pays so much more in the industry sector – but if we maintained a network of individuals who provided only a portion of their time to defending our country – well, then maybe we would have an excellent cyber force, balance cost, AND attract some individuals who would not typically be interested in the strict military rank structure. Something to consider….</p>

All the men looked dapper and the women looked marvelous. For a girl from Oviedo, Florida who never though she’d go to a ball….well, the world has smiled on me and I feel so blessed.</p>

<p>We watched a mens military choir – moved me to tears. Beautiful. We at the most exquisite beef and wine. So much lovely food. And I got the opportunity to thoroughly embarrass myself by trying to speak French with the two gentlemen next to me. But we vowed to learn more before the next meeting!! And sooooooo……I now begin a new adventure and life learning task – HOW DO I LEARN FRENCH IN SIX MONTHS?!! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
